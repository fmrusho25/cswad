<b>What is cloud computing?</b> <br>
Cloud computing is a common term for anything that is connected with delivering hosted services using the internet. These services are split into three types of cloud computing: infrastructure as a service-IaaS, platform as a service-PaaS, and software as a service-SaaS.
A cloud system can be private or public. A public cloud system sells services to anybody on the internet. A private cloud system is a proprietary network or a data center that supplies hosted services to a fixed number of people, with particular access and permissions settings. The private or public system, the target of cloud computing is to provide facile, scalable access to computing resources and Information Technology services.
Cloud infrastructure twists the hardware and software equipment required for the proper execution of a cloud computing model. Cloud computing systems can also be thought of as utility computing.
The word “cloud computing” was stimulated by the cloud sign that's often used to illustrate the Internet in flowcharts and graphs.

<br><b>How does cloud computing work?</b> <br>
Cloud computing works by allowing client machines to access data and cloud applications over the internet from small physical servers, databases, and computers.
An internet network association links the front end, which contains the accessing client machine, browser, web, and cloud software applications, with the back end, which consists of databases, servers, and computers. The back end functions as a storehouse, keeping data that is accessed by the front end.
Contacts between the front and back ends are managed by a central server. The main server depends on protocols to encourage the exchange of data. The central server operates both software and middleware to handle the connectivity between different client machines and cloud servers. Generally, there is a dedicated server for each particular application or workload.
Cloud computing depends heavily on virtualization and mechanization technologies. Virtualization allows the easy conception and provisioning of services and underlying cloud systems into rational entities that users can order and utilize. Industrialization and attending orchestration capabilities provide users with a high degree of self-service to provision help, connect services and deploy workloads without explicit intervention from the cloud provider's IT, staff.

<br><b>Types of cloud computing services</b> <br>
Cloud computing can be divided into three general service delivery categories or states of cloud computing:
IaaS. IaaS providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), supply a virtual server instance and storage, as well as application programming interfaces (APIs) that let users relocate workloads to a virtual machine (VM). Users have assigned storage power and can create, prevent, access, and configure the VM and hold it as expected. IaaS providers suggest small, medium, large, extra-large, and memory- or compute-optimized instances, in addition to enabling customization of models, for various workload needs. The IaaS cloud model is most comparable to a small database for company users.
PaaS. In the PaaS model, cloud providers host development tools on their infrastructures. Users access these tools over the internet utilizing APIs, net outlets, or gateway software. PaaS is used for general software development, and many PaaS providers host the software after it's developed. Common PaaS outcomes contain Salesforce's Lightning Platform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and Google App Engine.
SaaS. SaaS is a distribution model that delivers software applications over the internet; these applications are often called web services. Users can access SaaS applications and services from any place using a computer or mobile device that has internet access. In the SaaS model, users acquire access to application software and databases. One common model of a SaaS application is Microsoft 365 for productivity and email services.
 <br>
<b>Three cloud service categories</b> <br>

<br><b>Cloud computing deployment models</b> <br>
Personal cloud services are provided from a business's data center to internal users. With a personal cloud, an association builds and sustains its own underlying cloud infrastructure. This model offers the versatility and comfort of the cloud while keeping the administration, control, and protection standard of local data centers. Internal users may be billed for services through Information Technology chargeback. Common personal cloud technologies and agents include VMware and OpenStack.
In the public cloud standard, a third-party cloud service provider (CSP) provides the cloud service over the internet. Public cloud services are sold on request, normally by the minute or hour, though long-term promises are available for many services. Customers only pay for the central processing unit rotations, storage or bandwidth they consume. Directing public CSPs include AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as IBM, Oracle, and Tencent.
A hybrid cloud is a mixture of public cloud services and an on-premises personal cloud, with orchestration and mechanization between the two. Companies can run mission-essential workloads or sensitive applications on the personal cloud and use the public cloud to handle workload bursts or spikes in demand. The purpose of a hybrid cloud is to create a unified, automatic, scalable atmosphere that takes benefit of all that a public cloud infrastructure can deliver, while always possessing control over mission-critical data.
 
<br><b>The three main cloud deployment models</b> <br>
In expansion, communities are increasingly adopting a multi-cloud model or the use of multiple IaaS providers. This allows applications to migrate between various cloud providers or to even handle together across two or more cloud providers.
Associations assume multi-cloud for various causes. For example, they could do so to undervalue the risk of a cloud service outage or to bring the benefit of more competitive pricing from a certain provider. Multi-cloud performance and application growth can be a challenge because of the differences between cloud providers' services and APIs.
Multi-cloud deployments should develop easier, regardless, as providers' benefits and APIs connect and become more standardized via company ambitions such as Open Cloud Computing.
A community cloud, which is transmitted by several associations, support a particular community that shares the same concerns -- e.g., the same task, policy, security requirements, and compliance considerations. A community cloud is either managed by these organizations or a third-party agent and can be on or off-premises.


<br><b>Characteristics and advantages of cloud computing</b> <br>
Cloud computing has been about for several decades currently, and today's cloud computing infrastructure illustrates a collection of characteristics that have obtained meaningful usefulness to companies of all dimensions. Some of the major elements of cloud computing are the following:
Self-service provisioning. End users can turn up calculated resources for nearly any type of workload on request. An end-user can provide computing abilities, such as server time and web storage, destroying the standard need for IT executives to provision and manage to calculate resources.
Elasticity. Companies can voluntarily scale up as computing needs grow and scale down too as needs decrease. This annihilates the need for huge assets in local infrastructure, which may remain active.
Pay per use. Compute aids are calculated at a granular level, allowing users to pay only for the aids and workloads they handle.
Workload strength. CSPs usually execute redundant aids to ensure a resilient warehouse and to keep users' essential workloads handled-- usually across multiple global territories.
Migration flexibility. Associations can move specific workloads to or from the cloud -- or to various cloud platforms -- as desired or automatically for more reasonable cost consumings or to use new services as they appear.
Broad network access. A user can access cloud data or upload data to the cloud from any place with an internet connection using any machine.
Multi-tenancy. Multi-tenancy lets multiple customers communicate the same material infrastructures or the same applications yet still maintain privacy and protection over their own data. With resource pooling, cloud providers service multiple customers from the same physical resources. The resource collections of the cloud providers should be large and flexible sufficiently so they can service the conditions of multiple customers.
 
<br><b>An overview of cloud features and characteristics</b> <br>

These characteristics support a blend of important benefits for trendy businesses, including the following: 
Cost management. Using cloud infrastructure can decrease capital costs, as organizations don't have to pay huge amounts of money buying and supporting equipment. This decreases their capital expenditure prices-- as they don't have to support hardware, facilities, utilities, or making large data centers to accommodate their growing businesses. Further, organizations don't need large IT sections to handle cloud data center procedures because they can count on the expertise of their cloud providers' teams. Cloud computing also trims prices connected to downtime. Since downtime infrequently occurs in cloud computing, organizations don't have to consume time and money to fix any issues that might be related to downtime.
Data and workload mobility. Storing data in the cloud means that users can access it from any place with any device with only an internet connection. That means users don't have to maintain USB drives, an external hard drive, or multiple CDs to use their data. Users can access corporate data via smartphones and other mobile devices, allowing small employees to stay up to date with co-workers and customers. End users can efficiently process, store, retrieve and retrieve resources in the cloud. In addition, cloud agents provide all the upgrades and updates automatically, saving time and effort.
Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR). All associations are concerned regarding data loss. Storing data in the cloud guarantees that users can consistently access their data even if their machines, e.g., laptops or smartphones, are broken. With cloud-based services, associations can fast retrieve their data in the event of crises, such as natural disasters or power outages. This benefits BCDR and helps ensure that workloads and data are available even if the business mourns harm or trouble.

<br><b>Disadvantages of cloud computing</b> <br>
Despite the clear upsides to depending on cloud services, cloud computing bears its own challenges for IT specialists:
Cloud security. Protection is often considered the greatest challenge facing cloud computing. When depending on the cloud, associations threaten data breaches, hacking of APIs and interfaces, compromised credentials, and authentication issues. Furthermore, there is a shortage of transparency regarding how and where sensitive data entrusted to the cloud provider is operated. Security demands careful awareness of cloud configurations and business policy and practice.
Cost unpredictability. Pay-as-you-go subscription methods for cloud use, along with scaling aids to adjust fluctuating workload needs, can make it tough to define and predict final prices. Cloud prices are also repeatedly interdependent, with one cloud service usually utilizing one or more other cloud services -- all of which appear in the recurring monthly bill. This can create additional random cloud expenditures.
Insufficiency of ability and expertise. With cloud-supporting technologies rapidly advancing, associations are working to keep up with the growing demand for tools and employees with the proper skill sets and knowledge needed to engineer, deploy, and manage workloads and information in a cloud.
IT governance. The focus on do-it-yourself ability in cloud computing can make IT government complicated, as there is no control over provisioning, de-provisioning, and administration of infrastructure processes. This can make it challenging to appropriately manage threats and security, IT subordination, and data quality.
Compliance with industry laws. When transmitting data from on-premises local storage into cloud storage, it can be tough to handle subordination with industry regulations through a third party. It's important to know where data and workloads are actually hosted in order to maintain regulatory subordination and proper business management.
Management of multiple clouds. Every cloud is different, so multi-cloud deployments can disjoint struggles to address more general cloud computing difficulties.
Cloud performance. Performance -- such as latency -- is mostly outside the control of the organization hiring cloud services with a provider. Network and provider outages can interfere with productivity and disrupt corporation processes if associations are not prepared with contingency plans.
Building a private cloud. Architecting, building, and managing private clouds -- whether for their own objective or for a hybrid cloud plan-- can be a daunting job for IT units and teams.
Cloud migration. The method of moving applications and other data to a cloud infrastructure usually generates difficulties. Migration projects frequently bear longer than expected and go over allocation. The problem of workload and data repatriation -- shifting from the cloud back to a local data store-- is often overlooked until unforeseen price or implementation problems occur.
Agent lock-in. Often, switching between cloud providers can cause important problems. This includes technological incompatibilities, legal and regulatory restrictions, and substantial prices incurred from sizable data migrations.
<br>Cloud computing examples and use cases
<br>Cloud computing has developed and diversified into a wide collection of offerings and abilities designed to fit almost any conceivable business need. Examples of cloud computing capabilities and multiplicity include the following:
Google Docs, Microsoft 365. Users can access Google Docs and Microsoft 365 via the internet. Users can be more productive because they can access work presentations and spreadsheets stored in the cloud at any time from anywhere on any device.
Email, Calendar, Skype, WhatsApp. Emails, calendars, Skype, and WhatsApp take advantage of the cloud's ability to supply users with access to data remotely so they can access their personal data on any device, whenever and wherever they desire.
Zoom. Zoom is a cloud-based software platform for video and audio conferencing that records meetings and saves them to the cloud, enabling users to access them anywhere and at any time. Another common communication and collaboration platform is Microsoft Teams.
AWS Lambda. Lambda enables developers to run code for applications or back-end services without having to provision or manage servers. The pay-as-you-go model constantly scales with an organization to accommodate real-time changes in data usage and data storage. Other major cloud providers also support serverless computing capabilities, such as Google Cloud Functions and Azure Functions.
So, how is the cloud actually used? The myriad services and capabilities found in modern public clouds have been applied across countless use cases, such as the following:
Testing and development. Ready-made, tailored environments can expedite timelines and milestones.
Production workload hosting. Organizations are using the public cloud to host live production workloads. This requires careful design and architecture of cloud resources and services needed to create an adequate operational environment for the workload and its required level of resilience.
Big data analytics. Remote data centers through cloud storage are flexible and scalable and can provide valuable data-driven insights. Major cloud providers offer services tailored to big data projects, such as Amazon EMR and Google Cloud Dataproc.
IaaS. IaaS enables companies to host IT infrastructures and access compute storage and network capabilities in a scalable manner. Pay-as-you-go subscription models can help companies save on upfront IT costs.
PaaS. PaaS can help companies develop, run and manage applications in an easier and more elastic way, at a lower price than maintaining a platform on-premises. PaaS services can also increase the development speed for applications and allows higher-level programming.
Hybrid cloud. Associations have the chance to use the proper cloud -- private or public -- for different workloads and applications to optimize price and efficiency according to the occurrence.
Multi-cloud. Using multiple different cloud services from particular cloud providers can help subscribers find the most suitable cloud service fit for diverse workloads with specific requirements.
Storage. Large amounts of data can be stored remotely and accessed easily. Clients only have to pay for storage that they actually use.
DR. Cloud suggests faster recovery than traditional on-premises DR. Furthermore, it is suggested at lower costs.
Data backup. Cloud backup explanations are normally easier to use. Users do not have to worry about availability and capacity, and the cloud provider handles data security.


<br><b>Cloud computing vs. traditional web hosting</b> <br>
With the many different services and abilities of the public cloud, there has been some confusion between cloud computing and major uses, such as web hosting. While the public cloud is often used for web hosting, the two are quite different. A cloud service has three different features that discriminate it from traditional web hosting:
Users can access large amounts of computing power on demand. It is typically sold by the minute or the hour.
<br>It is elastic -- users can have as much or as little of a service as they want at any given time.
<br>The service is fully supervised by the provider -- the customer needs nothing but a personal computer and internet access. Important innovations in virtualization and distributed computing, as well as improved access to high-speed internet, have accelerated interest in cloud computing.
<br>Cloud computing service providers
<br>The cloud service demand has no shortage of providers. The three largest public CSPs that have demonstrated themselves as general fixtures in the industry are the following:
<br><b>AWS</b> <br>
<b>GCP</b> <br>
<b>Microsoft Azure</b> <br>
<b>Other major CSPs include the following:</b> <br>
<b>Apple</b> <br>
<b>Citrix</b> <br>
<b>IBM</b> <br>
<b>Salesforce</b> <br>
<b>Alibaba</b> <br>
<b>Oracle</b> <br>
<b>VMware</b> <br>
<b>SAP</b> <br>
<b>Joyent</b> <br>
<b>Rackspace</b> <br>
When considering a cloud service vendor, certain considerations should be taken. First, the actual suite of services can vary between providers, and business users must select a provider that offers services -- such as big data analytics or artificial intelligence (AI) services -- that support the intended use case.
Though cloud services typically rely on a pay-per-use model, different providers often have variations in their pricing plans to consider. Furthermore, if the cloud provider will be storing sensitive data, the physical location of the provider's servers should also be considered.
Naturally, reliability and security should be top priorities. A provider's service-level agreement should specify a level of service uptime that is satisfactory to client business needs. When considering different cloud vendors, close attention should be given to what technologies and configuration settings are used to secure sensitive information.
<br><b>Cloud computing security</b><br>
Security remains a primary concern for businesses contemplating cloud adoption -- especially public cloud adoption. Public CSPs share their underlying hardware infrastructure with numerous customers, as the public cloud is a multi-tenant environment. This environment demands significant isolation between logical compute resources. At the same time, access to public cloud storage and compute resources is guarded by account login credentials.
Many organizations bound by complex regulatory obligations and governance standards are still hesitant to place data or workloads in the public cloud for fear of outages, loss, or theft. However, this resistance is fading, as logical isolation has proven reliable and the addition of data encryption and various identity and access management tools have improved security within the public cloud.
Ultimately, the responsibility for establishing and maintaining a secure cloud environment falls to the individual business user that is responsible for building the workload's architecture -- the combination of cloud resources and services in which the workload runs -- and implementing the security features that the cloud provider offers.
<br>
<b>History of cloud computing</b> <br>
The history and evolution of cloud computing date back to the 1950s and 1960s.
In the 1950s, companies started to use large mainframe computers, but it was too expensive to buy a computer for each user. So, during the late 1950s and early 1960s, a process called time-sharing was developed to make more efficient use of expensive processor time on the central mainframe.
Time-sharing enabled users to access numerous instances of computing mainframes simultaneously, maximizing processing power and minimizing downtime. This idea represents the first use of shared computing resources, the foundation of modern cloud computing.
The origins of delivering computing resources using a global network are, for the most part, rooted in 1969 when American computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider helped create the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, the so-called precursor to the internet. Licklider's goal was to connect computers across the globe in a way that would enable users to access programs and information from any location.
In the 1970s, cloud computing began taking a more tangible shape with the introduction of the first VMs, enabling users to run more than one computing system within a single physical setup. The functionality of these VMs led to the concept of virtualization, which had a major influence on the progress of cloud computing.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Microsoft, Apple, and IBM developed technologies that enhanced the cloud environment and advanced the use of cloud servers and server hosting. Then, in 1999, Salesforce became the first company to deliver business applications from a website.
In 2006, Amazon launched AWS, providing such services as computing and storage in the cloud. Following suit, the other major tech players, including Microsoft and Google, subsequently launched their own cloud offerings to compete with AWS.
<b>Future of cloud computing and emerging technologies</b> <br>
Over 30% of inventor IT decision-makers marked the public cloud system as their top priority in 2019, according to the "RightScale 2019 State of the Cloud Report." Still, companies' adoption of the public cloud, especially for mission-critical applications, hasn't been happening as quickly as many experts predicted.
Today, however, institutions are more likely to change mission-critical workloads to public clouds. One of the reasons for this shift is that business executives who want to ensure that their companies can compete in the new world of digital transformation are demanding the public cloud.
Business leaders are also looking to the public cloud to take advantage of its elasticity, modernize internal computer systems, and empower critical business units and their DevOps teams.
Additionally, cloud providers, such as IBM and VMware, are concentrating on meeting the needs of enterprise IT, in part by removing the barriers to public cloud adoption that caused IT decision-makers to shy away from fully embracing the public cloud previously.
Generally, when contemplating cloud adoption, many enterprises have been mainly focused on new cloud-native applications -- that is, designing and building applications specifically intended to use cloud services. They haven't been willing to move their most mission-critical apps into the public cloud. However, these enterprises are now beginning to realize that the cloud is ready for the enterprise if they select the right cloud platforms, i.e., those that have a history of serving the needs of the enterprise.
Cloud providers are locked in the ongoing competition for cloud market share, so the public cloud continues to evolve, expand and diversify its range of services. This has led public IaaS providers to offer far more than common compute and storage instances.
For example, serverless, or event-driven, computing is a cloud service that executes specific functions, such as image processing and database updates. Traditional cloud deployments require users to establish a compute instance and load code into that instance. Then, the user decides how long to run -- and pay for -- that instance.
With serverless computing, developers simply create code, and the cloud provider loads and executes that code in response to real-world events so users don't have to worry about the server or instance aspect of the cloud deployment. Users only pay for the number of transactions that the function executes. AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions are examples of serverless computing services.
Public cloud computing also lends itself well to big data processing, which demands enormous compute resources for relatively short durations. Cloud providers have responded with big data services, including Google BigQuery for large-scale data warehousing and Microsoft Azure Data Lake Analytics for processing huge data sets.
Another crop of emerging cloud technologies and services relates to AI and machine learning. These technologies provide a range of cloud-based, ready-to-use AI and machine learning services for client needs. Amazon Machine Learning, Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine, and Google Cloud Speech API are examples of these services.
